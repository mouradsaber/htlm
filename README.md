# Collection of HTML Examples and Web Pages

This project is a collection of various HTML files, serving different purposes from learning examples to specific webpage mockups.

## Files

Below is a list of the primary HTML files in this repository and a brief description of their content:

*   **`HtmlCourse1.html`**: A personal blog page titled "Mr. Whishers' Blog Page," featuring sections about a cat named Mr. Whiskers, including posts and contact information.
